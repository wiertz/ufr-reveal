There is space.

## Different styles I

There are some predefined styles. This is the "objective" style that I use to present objectives (e.g., of a talk, a project, a lecture).

::: {.column width="50%"}
Title left column

- Left column 1
- Left column 2
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
Title right column

- Right column 1
- Right column 2
:::

## Different styles II {type=task}

This is another style used to present tasks.

1. Please do this first.
2. Then move on to this.
3. And finally, write it all down.

## Conclusion {style="conclusion"}

This concludes the style. If you have questions or comments, please contact me at [thilo.wiertz@geographie.uni-freiburg.de](mailto:thilo.wiertz@geographie.uni-freiburg.de).

::: {style="color: var(--ufr-yellow-dark);"}
I should say this is important, too!
:::

::: aside
You can see that the conclusion also uses a different style.
