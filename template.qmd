## About this project

## Agenda 

::: {.agenda}
- Formatting examples
- A single column slide
- ...futher chapters
:::

## Formatting examples
### You can add subtitles as third level headlines

Adding a div by using `::: {.spacer}` creates a blank space.

::: {.spacer}
:::

So this line is set apart from the one before.

## A single column slide

Text before a list is emphasized automatically

- Lorem ipsum 1
- Lorem ipsum 2
- Lorem ipsum 3

::: {.aside}
Note that there is a side remark in an `.aside` div.
:::

## Highlights

To highlight a piece of text, put it in a div:

::: {.block-pink}
`::: {.block-pink}`
:::

::: {.block-green}
`::: {.block-green}`
:::

::: {.block-yellow}
`::: {.block-yellow}`
:::

## Blockquote

> This is something that a very smart person said.

## Compact lines

Use `::: {.compact}` to reduce line height:

::: {.spacer}
:::

::: {.compact}
Sometimes stuff should be more compact:

- Lorem ipsum 1
- Lorem ipsum 2
- Lorem ipsum 3
:::
